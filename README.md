My Experience Building the Todo App:
Building the Todo App has been an exciting journey! I had the opportunity to dive deeper into React and explore various libraries and tools to enhance the user experience. Throughout the development process, I encountered challenges and triumphs that helped me grow as a developer.

Lessons Learned and Improvements Made:
While developing the Todo App, I learned the importance of code organization and the power of React's context and hooks. I improved my skills in handling state management, conditional rendering, and responsiveness, which resulted in a more user-friendly and performant application.

Words of Wisdom:
Embrace the process of learning and improvement. Every challenge you encounter is an opportunity to grow and enhance your skills. Don't be afraid to explore new technologies and experiment with different approaches. Stay curious, keep coding, and never stop striving for excellence! Happy coding! :)

Built With

Tailwind CSS: The utility-first CSS framework utilized to style the components and create a responsive design.
Headless UI: The set of completely unstyled, fully accessible UI components for React used to enhance the user experience and interactivity of the application.
